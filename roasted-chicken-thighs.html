            <ol>
                <li>
                    heat the oven to about 420째F (215째C). while it's heating up, do this:
                </li>
                <li>
                    wash the chicken thighs under cold water, massage them a little bit
                </li>
                <li>
                    put them in a pan lined with foil, deep enough that <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jus#Noun">jus</a> won't get everywhere when they're done
                </li>
                <li>
                    cover them with olive oil, then balsamic vinegar
                </li>
                <li>
                    season well with onion powder, then garlic powder, then cayenne, then paprika, then powdered sage
                </li>
                <li>
                    flip the thighs over and season them again
                </li>
                <li>
                    flip the thighs so that the skin side is up (if they have skin) and salt them with a little bit of salt, but not a ton bc we don't want hypertension
                </li>
                <li>
                    throw a bay leaf in for every three to four thighs
                </li>
                <li>
                    cook in the pre-heated oven for about 45 minutes until done (internal temp of 165째F/74째C)
                </li>
                <li>
                    take them out of the oven, baste them in the jus, and then let them sit for like 5 minutes
                </li>
                <li>
                    enjoy
                </li>
            </ol>
